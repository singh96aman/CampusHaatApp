# Reverse Geocoding

Implemented it while appearing for internship test at CampusHaat Solution. Using Reverse Geocoding, if we have latitude and longitude coordinates, we can pin point exactly the Pincode, Street, Landmarks, City and Country of the user. Another feature is the use of Google Maps V2 in fragment to pinpoint locations.
